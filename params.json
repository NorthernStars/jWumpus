{"name":"jWumpus","tagline":"Java based wumpus game for artifical intelligences","body":"# Download latest binary package\r\nYou can find the latest release at https://github.com/NorthernStars/jWumpus/releases.\r\n\r\n## Project description\r\njWumpus is a java based library for easy programming own artrifical intelligences to solve the wumpus world problem.\r\n\r\njWumpus includes a set of objects like a wumpus world map, objets on that map, action a agend can do and more to make programming an own AI easier. Also a graphical user interface and an editor are included to easily manage AI processing and wumpus world map creation.\r\n\r\n### Wumpus world problem\r\n\r\nInside the wumpus world there is an agent that wants to find the gold of the monster called wumpus.\r\nThe world consists of rectangular fields. The agend can move only one field up, down, left or right.\r\n\r\nAt the fields around the wumpus the agent can smell a stench. At the fields around a trap the agend can fell a breeze. And (depending on the variant of the problem) at the fields around the gold a twinkle.\r\nThe agend knows always on wich field he is but can not see anithing of the world on start.\r\n\r\n![600px-wumpus_welt svg](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3993793/2423907/d7e2ccba-aba0-11e3-8c19-69e2d3736dcd.png)\r\n\r\nThe agent also has a bow with one arrow. Using this bow he can try to shoot the wumpus by shooting into one direction (up, down, left, right).\r\n\r\nThe agend has to move through the wumpus world and tries to find the gold and detect positions of traps and the wumpus.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![editor](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3993793/2423971/b5da81e8-aba1-11e3-8481-9492472c4382.png)\r\n\r\n## Starting with jWumpus\r\nIf you includes jWumpus into your build path, create a new class for you AI and implement the `WumpusAI` interface from jWumpus. The interface includes a set of functions. Take a look at the examples to knwo more about them. Most important are the functions `public void putWumpusWorldMap(WumpusMap map)` wich is called by jWumpus main class to put a new wumpus world map into your AI and `public Movement getMovement()` wich calculates a `Movement` depending on the `WumpusMap` your AI gets from jWumpus main class.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
