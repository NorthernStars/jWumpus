<p>jWumpus is a java based library for easy programming of own artrifical intelligences (AI) to solve the wumpus world problem.</p>

<p>jWumpus includes a set of objects like a wumpus world map, objets on that map, actions an AI agend can do and more to make programming an own AI easier. Also a graphical user interface and an editor are included to easily manage AI processing and wumpus world map creation.</p>

<h3>
<a name="wumpus-world-problem" class="anchor" href="#wumpus-world-problem"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Wumpus world problem</h3>

<p>Inside the wumpus world there is an agent that wants to find the gold of the monster called wumpus.
The world consists of rectangular fields. Each step the agend can move only one field up, down, left or right.</p>

<p>At the fields around the wumpus the agent can smell a stench. At the fields around a trap the agend can fell a breeze. And (depending on the variant of the problem) at the fields around the gold a twinkle.
The agend knows always on wich field he is but can not see anything of the world except the field hes standing on.</p>

<p>The agent also has a bow with one ore more arrows. Using this bow he can try to shoot the wumpus by shooting into one direction (up, down, left, right).</p>

<p>The agend has to move through the wumpus world and tries to find the gold and detect positions of traps and the wumpus.</p>

<a name="starting-with-jwumpus" class="anchor" href="#starting-with-jwumpus"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Starting with jWumpus</h2>

<p>To start include jWumpus into your build path, create a new class for you AI and implement the <code>WumpusAI</code> interface from jWumpus. The interface includes a set of functions. Take a look at the examples to knwo more about that.</p>

<p>Most important are the functions <code>public void putWumpusWorldMap(WumpusMap map)</code> wich is called by jWumpus main class to put a new wumpus world map into your AI and <code>public Action getAction()</code> wich calculates a <code>Action</code> depending on the <code>WumpusMap</code> your AI gets from jWumpus main class.</p>

<p>To start the AI use a call like
<code>new JWumpus( new ExampleAI() );</code>
wich generates a new JWumpus object and passes a new AI instance to it. The JWumpus objects start the graphical user interface that offers control to load a map, or requesting the next action to do from AI.</p>

<h2>
<a name="examples" class="anchor" href="#examples"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Examples</h2>

<p>jWumpus includes two examples. Each example includes a own main function so that they can get started directly from within projects directory.</p>

<h3>
<a name="examplehumaninterface" class="anchor" href="#examplehumaninterface"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ExampleHumanInterface</h3>

<p>ExampleHumanInterface shows the general graphical user interface that offers direct access to the control functions of JWumpus class. It also loads a interface to set the next action the AI should do.

<h3>
<a name="examplehumaninterfaceonly" class="anchor" href="#examplehumaninterfaceonly"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ExampleHumanInterfaceOnly</h3>

<p>ExampleHumanInterfaceOnly shows only a interface for loading a map or showing the map editor. If a map is loaded the AI automatically starts a automatic step processing and the next action the AI should do could be set through the graphical user interface.
